Theory:
    How we use them to make predictions
    How we correct parameters of neural network to make better predictions
    Then we will use wyat we have learnt to implement forward and backward passes of a neural network.
    Then we will train the parameters using gradient descent.

    In the end you will have a full neural network that you can use to predict tomorrow's weather.
